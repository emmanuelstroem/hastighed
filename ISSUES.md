# Issues and Solutions

## Phase 1 Issues

### No known issues at this time

## General Notes

- All location permissions are properly handled
- GPS updates are optimized for battery life (1 meter distance filter)
- Street name updates only occur when the street actually changes
- UserDefaults integration for persistent street name storage

## Future Considerations

- Monitor GPS accuracy in different environments
- Consider adding location accuracy indicators
- May need to handle edge cases for very fast movement
